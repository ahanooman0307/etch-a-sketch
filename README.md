# etch-a-sketch

Created an Etch-a-Sketch  webpage game with user interface. 
Users have the option to select any color to draw on the Etch-a-Sketch with the user interface. Users also have the option for a rainbow path, eraser, or to clear the grid. The size of the grid can also be changed by using the slider. 
Built with Javascript, HTML/CSS


I learned how to manipulate HTML elements using Javascript. 
I also learned how to design an algorithm to create grids that can be affected by user's input.
